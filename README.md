**BlackLung** is a PoC windows based ransomware virus, fully written in python. **BlackLung** has many features including a built in safeguard, which is enabled by default so you don't accidentally encrypt your files on your main system. However, you can disable the safeguard if you want to. 

###### Features of BlackLung ransomware:

1. Safeguard - (Enabled by default)
1. Generate a random key every time BlackLung is run
2. Grab hostname of victim's machine
3. Grab current date and time of the victim's machine
4. Send the key, hostname and current date and time of the victim's machine to a server - (Disabled by default as the server script is not publicly accessible).
5. Encrypt all files on the C: drive

**BlackLung Ransomware is just a POC  (Proof of concept) ransomware virus, and it's code is strictly for educational purposes**  
**Any illegal use of BlackLung Ransomware or it's source code is strictly prohibited and will result in the source code for Blacklung Ransomware being removed from the public domain and all public access to it's source code, Wiki's, and Github page will be revoked permanently.**  

**Note that even though I have already created the server script (the server that the ransomware sends the key, and the hostname of the victim to), I will not be making it publicly available/accessible due to legal reasons.**  



## WARNING: 
**Since the server script is not publicly available, once you run BlackLung THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY TO GET YOUR FILES BACK!!! You have been warned!!!**
